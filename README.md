Game Programming Project 1: Roll A Ball Maze.

A game where you control a ball and try to navigate through a short maze to reach the end.

Players will be hurt when coming into contact with a wall. If the players health falls below zero, they will lose and the game will restart.

Health regenerating pickups are layed out across the map.

The goal is to reach the end as quickly as you can without dying. Upon reaching the end, you will be presented with a maze completion time.

Play again to try and beat your last score! Have fun!
